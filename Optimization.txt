Which solution is more optimiazed depends on different situations. 

The worst case, if there are n artitists in each list and m lists, and no artists is the same, then the totoal number of artists is n*m:
In the brute force solution, when we loop thru the artists in each list to find all pairs,the size of the each artists list is n. The process of finding the pairs takes run time (n)^2*m
In solution1,when we loop thru all the artists from the map to find the pairs, there are total n*m artists(if no artists is the same)in the map. The process of finding the pairs takes run time (n*m)^2*m
In this situation, brute force solution has less run time than solution 1.

However, more realistically and more likely,the same artists would appear in many lists, the total number of artists is far less than n*m.Plus,after reducing the map size in solution1,it will take
less run time to go thru all the artists in the map to find the pairs. In this case and more realistically, solution1 is more optimiazed than the brute force solution.
